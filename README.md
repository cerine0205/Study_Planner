# Study Planner System

## Overview
The Study Planner System is a console-based application developed in C# using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
It helps students organize academic tasks, manage deadlines, track progress, and focus on high-priority work.

An executable version of the application is available for download in the Releases section.

## Project Objectives
- Build a structured academic task management system.
- Apply abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- Implement priority filtering and progress tracking features.
- Ensure reliable input validation and system testing.

---

## Features
- Add Study Sessions
- Add Deadline Tasks
- View All Tasks
- Mark Tasks as Completed
- Filter Tasks by Priority (High Priority View)
- Calculate Progress Percentage
- Save and Load Data using JSON
- Input Validation Handling

## System Architecture

### Core Classes
- PlannerItem (Abstract Base Class)
- StudySession (Derived Class)
- DeadlineTask (Derived Class)
- Planner (Manages task operations)
- FileStorage (Handles JSON serialization and persistence)

---

## OOP Principles Applied
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

---

## Data Persistence
The system uses JSON serialization to save and load planner data, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

---

## Testing
The system was tested for:
- Task creation accuracy
- Priority filtering functionality
- Completion status updates
- Input validation
- Handling empty result scenarios

All major functionalities were validated successfully.
